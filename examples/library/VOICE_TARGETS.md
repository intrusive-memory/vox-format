# Voice Library Targets

## Introduction

The VOX Voice Library provides a curated set of description-designed voice identities for common text-to-speech use cases. These voices serve as ready-to-use starting points for audiobook production, character-driven narratives, multilingual content, and genre-specific synthesis. The target audience includes podcast producers, game developers, accessibility tool creators, and screenwriters who need high-quality, ethically unencumbered voice definitions. All voices are designed from text descriptions only and released under CC0-1.0 for unrestricted use.

## Categories

### Narrators

Professional voices optimized for sustained, long-form delivery. Narrators maintain listener engagement across extended content while conveying authority, warmth, or dramatic energy. These voices prioritize clarity, consistent pacing, and tonal stability.

### Characters

Fictional character voices with defined personalities, age profiles, and emotional ranges. Each includes role context and relationship metadata for audiobook dialogue, game NPCs, and dramatic readings. Characters span common storytelling archetypes.

### Accents

Regional and linguistic accent variations bringing geographic authenticity to voice output. Distinguished by pronunciation patterns, cadence, and cultural vocal markers. Each accent targets a specific regional identity.

### Ages

Voices that foreground a particular life stage as their primary characteristic. These are designed to embody the vocal qualities of youth, maturity, or advanced age as the defining trait, independent of character archetype.

### Genres

Voices tailored to specific content genres where tonal expectations are strong. Genre voices carry stylistic conventions -- the gravity of news, the intimacy of meditation, the tension of thriller narration -- as their primary signature.

## Notes

These targets represent a planning document, not a commitment to deliver every voice in the initial release. The list may evolve based on usage patterns, community feedback, and technical feasibility. Priorities may shift -- if demand concentrates around narrators and characters, accent and genre voices could be deferred.

All voices use method `"designed"` in their provenance. No voice is cloned from a real person. This ensures every library voice can be used without consent concerns or licensing restrictions.

The language distribution (en, es, fr) is a starting point. Future iterations should expand based on community needs and TTS engine support for description-based voice design.
